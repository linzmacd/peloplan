## About Me

Hi! I'm Lindsay, a freshly minted software engineer having recently completed an immersive 12-week full-stack software engineering fellowship at Hackbright Academy. I originally studied bioengineering and business at UC Berkeley and worked in biotech for the better part of a decade before moving into a management role in the hospitality industry. The only constant throughout my career has been my perpetual drive to make things better, be it through problem-solving, improving efficiency, reducing waste, or eliminating redundancies. I look forward to bringing that same curiosity and determination into the next chapter of my career as a software engineer. I hope you enjoyed my web app and demo, please feel free to connect if you have any questions or feedback. Thank you!
