# PeloPlan

A workout planning and schedule sharing app for Peloton users.

## Features

[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR8js2b2S1I)

After a user connects to their Peloton account, PeloPlan displays a calendar of their workout history and allows them to build their schedule with classes from the Peloton course catalog or generic workouts that can be decided on later. Users can track their progress over time to see whether they are sticking to their PeloPlan, as well as view their workout history breakdown and their cycling outputs over time. They can also reuse or share their schedules as well as rate other users’ publicly shared schedules and load them on their own calendar. Users can search for their friends by name or email and follow them to share schedules on PeloPlan.

## About Me

Hello, I'm Lindsay, a freshly-minted software engineer. I originally studied bioengineering and business at UC Berkeley and worked in biotech for the better part of a decade before moving into a management role in the hospitality industry. The only constant throughout my career has been my perpetual drive to make things better, be it through problem-solving, improving efficiency, reducing waste, or eliminating redundancies. I’m looking forward to bringing that same curiosity and determination into the next chapter of my career as a software engineer. I hope you enjoyed my web app and demo and please feel free to connect if you have any questions or feedback. Thanks!
